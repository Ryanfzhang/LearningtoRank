""" Semi-supervised ranking: MQ2007-semi | MQ2008-semi """
Semi-supervised rankingThe data format in this setting is the same as that in supervised ranking setting.
The only difference is that the datasets in this setting contains both judged and undged query-document pair (*** in training set but not in validation and testing set ***)
while the datasets in supervised ranking contain only judged query-document pair. The relevance label “-1” indicates the query-document pair is not judged.

''' According to {Introducing {LETOR} 4.0 Datasets}, "QueryLevelNorm version: Conduct query level normalization based on data in MIN version. This data can be directly used for learning. We further provide 5 fold partitions of this version for cross fold validation".
 --> Thus there is no need to perform query_level_scale again for {MQ2007_super | MQ2008_super | MQ2007_semi | MQ2008_semi}

 --> But for {MSLRWEB10K | MSLRWEB30K}, the query-level normalization is ## not conducted yet##.

 --> For {Yahoo_L2R_Set_1 | Yahoo_L2R_Set_1 }, the query-level normalization is already conducted.
